Description = Plugin to export the ilastik tracking results as contours (used mainly to export larvae contours for Zlatics Lab). Each .outline file consists of a line for each frame the animal is tracked for. The first number on this line is the timestamp of the frame, followed by the id, and an unused number left as 0.000, and then the rest of numbers are the (x,y) coordinates of the contour points (in pixels). Numbers are separated by a single white space.<br> <br> <b>Usage: </b> Select the filename where the contours will be saved to an ASCII file. <br> <br> The resulting file will contain a list of 3 words, followed by the (x,y) coordinates for the contour information of each object.
