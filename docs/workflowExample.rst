================================================================================
Building your own workflow using the watershedSegmentation workflow
================================================================================
Define the variables, python and so on for this particular terminal, 
so that ilastik has everything it wants to have:

.. code::

        $ source activate ilastik-devel


Show workflow in ilastik
========================================

Open the file

.. code::

        $ ilastik/workflows/__init__.py

add the following lines (adjusted to your project) at the disired position, 
between which other workflows it should lie:

.. code::

        try:
            import watershedSegmentation
            WORKFLOW_CLASSES += [watershedSegmentation.watershedSegmentationWorkflow.WatershedSegmentationWorkflow]
        except ImportError as e:
            logger.warn("Failed to import 'watershedSegmentation' workflow; check dependencies: " + str(e))



Afterwards you can see your workflow in the following list:


.. figure:: images/list_of_workflows.jpg
   :scale: 70  %
   :alt: list of workflows

   List of possible workflows in ilastik, if you want to open a new project.


Basic File Structure
========================================

Then create a folder in 
ilastik/workflows/
with the name watershedSegmentation:
In this directory there are 2 files:

#. __init__.py

.. literalinclude:: ../ilastik/workflows/watershedSegmentation/__init__.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

#. watershedSegmentationWorkflow.py

   * Includes all the applets for this workflow and how they are connected with each other

   * Includes all the exposing to the shell and the update handling for applets

   

Basic Structure in watershedSegmentationWorkflow.py
================================================================================

Our Workflow should inherit from:

.. currentmodule:: ilastik.workflow
.. class:: Workflow
        :noindex:


* In the init, you create all necessary applets for later use and expose them to the shell
        .. currentmodule:: ilastik.workflows.watershedSegmentation.watershedSegmentationWorkflow
        .. automethod:: WatershedSegmentationWorkflow.__init__

* The function 

        .. code::

            def connectLane(self, laneIndex):

        connects applets with each other. 
        Therefore one OutputSlot of the frist applet can be connected via 'pyQt: connect'
        to the InputSlot of the second applet. That means, the second applet gets the output of the first applet. 

        Normally this looks like this (click on the source link for viewing the code):

        .. currentmodule:: ilastik.workflows.watershedSegmentation.watershedSegmentationWorkflow
        .. autoclass:: WatershedSegmentationWorkflow
                :members: connectLane

        .. note::

                Use the OpReorderAxes Operator to have a consistant order in all applets. 
                A hack can be used in the __init__ therefore, see code below.


        .. code::

                self.dataSelectionApplet = DataSelectionApplet(self, "Input Data", "Input Data", "Input Data", forceAxisOrder=['txyzc'])



*  
        .. automethod:: WatershedSegmentationWorkflow.handleAppletStateUpdateRequested

     this handles, whether the applets will be clickable and whether they propagte dirty signals. 

     To make this function executed in an applet, this function call should be done, 
     so that an ineditable applet becomes usable:

     .. code::

             self.parentApplet.appletStateUpdateRequested.emit()

     In the watershedSegmentationWorkflow, this behaviour is not welcomed for the 
     seeds and the watershed applet. If it was so, the propagate dirty signal of 
     any changes wouldn't come further to the watershed applet, and the 
     reset of the Labels wouldn't happen either. 



* In conclusion, look for "ataSelection" to get all the important parts, where you have to add something

        The residual of the class isn't that important for the basic understanding and make your workflow just work. 
        Of course it handles all the headless and batch modes and more. 


        For further information, you can read the comments in the watershedSegmentationWorkflow and look at other workflows to get a better understanding.
